1,i think on the local elections it's actually that i know and really think people vote to the larger government because people feel pretty well you know the country's real president and you know when i elect if at elect a president who's going to save it then the then the whole country will be saved but they figure local elections don't mean as much as suspect so people don't ever worry over their local mayor that something me that just know um and i think wrongly figuring that very well what good is their mayor going to make? because our property taxes are really important right now and you know and i like that but really think that that that they don't have um that says it doesn. t doesn'not matter as much whereas i think it's probably just the opposite is true i hope.'as s the case that people would have more effect on a personal level that think more people vote during the presidential elections than people will.
1,"i check on the local news,'s actually um i think um i think people vote before the larger elections because they feel that well you control the country's real capital and you know if i elect if we help elect our president it's going not save me then the then the whole world will be different but really figure local elections don't do how much i suspect so people didn't really worry about their money. and something figuring that you know um and i think you figuring that that well what good not another state going to do anyway because our federal taxes seem not important right now and you know and stuff like that so people think that saying that they don't have um that that it doesn't doesn't mean as much as i say it is s probably because the opposite is true i think it's probably the case that people = has same effect on the local level most think you bigger vote during the national elections than romanowski."
1,i thought on the local elections it's actually um i think um i think they not in the federal elections because they feel like well you know this country's real history and you know if somebody elect somebody and help elect our president who doesn s going to save us from the man the president that will be saved but they figure local elections don ′ t mean that much i suspect so people don't really worry about their local election or something figuring that nobody know it but i think wrongly figuring that as well what they is another mayor going to be anyway because his federal taxes are more effective right now and i know and i trust that so people think that that that they don'ex have it that that that doesn't doesn't matter as much whereas if really there's probably just the opposite is true i think it's probably the opposite that people can have vote vote on a personal level i believe more people vote at the presidential elections in local elections.
1,i think on the local elections it's actually um i think um i think people vote in the larger part because they feel like well you know the state's real important and you know what i elect them we help elect that president nobody's going to save us then the then the whole country will are saved but they figure local voters don think me him that much some suspect that you don't people worry about becoming local mayor or something but are you mean um and i think wrongly but all that well what next is the mayor going to do anyway because our federal taxes seem more important here now and people know and stuff like that so people think that that if they don't have um that that it doesn't werent t nearly as much whereas i think she'n probably just the opposite is true i think it's just the case that people who have more influence on a local government i mean more people vote during us presidential elections than the elections.
1,"i think with the local politicians it\'s actually um i think um i think people like in the larger elections because they get too well you know the country\'s real important and you know if i elect if we help elect this president who\'r going to save us then the way the whole country will be saved but they figure local mayor i\'e mean like people i suspect "" people don\'s really have like their local mayor or something figuring that you know um. i think wrongly figuring that that well the it is another mayor going home around anyway because our federal politicians are more important right now and you say and me like that people and think that that that they don\'t have um no that it doesn\'t won\'t matter as much whereas i believe it\'s probably just the thing is true i know it\'s probably the case that it could have more support on state this level i guess more people out during the presidential term than local politics )"
1,i think on the local elections that's actually um i think um i think people vote in different larger elections like they feel like if you know the national is the less important and you know so i elect if we help elect the president who's going to save us then the more the whole city will be saved and it being local you shouldn't mean that you the suspect so people don't think about with their local mayor or me figuring that you know it and i think that figuring that that well what good is another mayor going to say anyway because our federal taxes are more efficient right now and you know and stuff like that so everyone think that that that they don't have um the that which doesn'or doesn't matter help much whereas the so it's probably just the opposite so true me think it's probably our case that people could have more effect over a social level i think more influence happening during the presidential elections than local elections.
1,"i think on the local elections everything\'s actually um i think um i think people die in the larger elections because they think like well you know the country gets so so important and you know if i elect people we help elect a president who was s going to help us then so then the whole country will be saved but they figure local democracy doesn\'t mean that if i suppose so that don don t really worry about their local mayor or those figuring that you know um, i say wrongly figuring how so well what good is another country going to do anyway because if they politicians are pretty important right now and you know and stuff like that so people think that that that they don\'t have um that and it doesn it t about\'to matter much that whereas i think what "" s probably just the opposite is just i think what\'s probably the idea that people could have more effect on us local level i think more we vote during the presidential elections and local elections."
1,i think on the smaller elections it's that um i say um i think people vote for the larger elections because they feel like what you know the country ain s real important for me even if i elect if to people elect a guy who's going to save you then the then the whole country will be saved as they figure in elections donne we mean so much i suspect so people don't really worry about a local mayor or something figuring that he know um and i think wrongly figuring just that well what good is another thing thing to do anyway because our water taxes are real important back now and you know and stuff like that so people forget that is that they don't have um but that it doesn't doesn't pay as much whereas i like it to say that just the saying is true i think it's probably the case that they could have more people on a regional level i think more people die during the presidential elections than local government.
