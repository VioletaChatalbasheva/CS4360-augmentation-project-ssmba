1,i work on some local days it. s actually um i think um i think people vote about to larger elections because they feel those their animals know the country's real way and will know if i elect if we help elect a flourishing government's going to save us up um then the real country will be saved but they figure that elections don t t mean that much i suspect so people don ′ t really worry about their local fists or something figuring that you know um and i think wrongly knowing that very well what good club be was going to do me in and federal that are more important right now and you know and stuff like that you people think that that that they wouldn't have um that that it doesn't didn't matter as much whereas i think it's probably just the opposite is true i think it's another best case why people to have more effect on a local level i mean more people participate into the presidential elections than general elections.
1,i think on the local elections it's possible right i think um i like people vote in even larger elections because they can like well you know the country ` s real important and f people if everyone elect if we help to the or who's trying to save us then then then the entire country will be important but still figure local elections don't mean that you or suspect so people don't really worry about their elected mayor or someone figuring that you know what and i think wrongly figuring that... well and there is another we going to do anyway because their that taxes are more important right now and you know they we like that so people think that that that they don't have that that that it doesn't doesn't matter as much whereas i think it'n probably just the opposite of true i think it it s probably the case as if can have more power on a local level i think more people vote during a presidential elections more local elections.
1,"i think about the local elections it\'s actually um i think um i think people vote it in national elections like they feel like well they know the country\'s pretty important and you know if i elect if we help elect a president who\'s going to save everybody us the then the whole country will be saved but they figure local elections don\'t change that much i know so people don "" t really worry about their local mayor or something like that you know that and i am not figuring them that well. how is another mayor going to do anyway? our federal elections are all important right now and you know and stuff like that so people think that just that they don\'t have um that um it doesn\'t doesn not\'matter so much whereas some think it\'s basically very its opposite. true i think here\'is probably the case that people could have more effect on a local level i think more people vote during the general cycle than local elections."
1,"we think on the local level it's actually important i think um i think people vote into the larger picture because we feel like well you know the country's very important and you know why i elect if we help elect a president who's going to save us for the then the whole country will be saved they we figure local politics dona just mean that much i suspect so people don'l really know elect this local mayor or something figuring like you know um maybe i think wrongly figuring that that something the good is another mayor going to do anyway because our federal taxes are not important right now than you know and stuff else, so people think that that that they don can t have um well that it doesn't doesn't matter me it so i guess it's probably just the opposite is true i think it's probably the case that people could have more freedom to a local level i think most people mean during the presidential race than most before |"
