2,and it's what's quite a bit on the six something from the state system and uh - restof the pie stuff elsewhere but we're within a particular part of the district that't pretty well known so it's that's like we get a bit of that back as far as local taxation and i do not care exactly where the local taxes went.
2,"and it = s it's you that but you think six something is the state and and uh, rest of the pie goes. but we're in one a part of the state but'm pretty bad off so it's it's like you get a lot of that back as far as local taxation as i do not know exactly where many local taxes go."

2,"and that - s it'n quite a bit i think six states across the state and then uh, most of the pie goes elsewhere, you're in a small part of the state that's pretty way off and it'l it's like we get a share of that because as far as local taxation goes i would not know right where the local taxes go."
2,"and it's it's quite '. i think, something is the state and and hence the whole of the pie are elsewhere but also is especially in a particular part of a state that's pretty well off so it's always's like we get a lot of that back as far as local taxation goes, why not know exactly where the local taxes go."

2,and it's it'd quite a bit more think six something about the state and and uh the rest of the pie goes elsewhere but we're in a particular portion of the state that's pretty good far so how the s he's like we get whole lot of that back as far as local taxation goes i happen not know just where the bills can go.

1,me and i you know some think defense really supports what wins wins uh in short long run you can have the best half back there is or even best quarterback but when they don't have any blocking maybe they haven'll do anything we think a good offense but the most important thing you need to during games.
1,"oh and i you know, think defense really has what offense wins uh in the season run but can have the best defence back there britney or the right quarterback but if it don't have any blocking maybe that can't do anything i think a good defense is the most important thing you need to win games."
1,"so and i you know i think defense really is what wins wins in at any long run you can have the, half back there, or the best, but if they don't have better blocking maybe they can't do anything i think a good defense is the most important thing you take to win it."
1,say and like you go i think defense football is what wins wins uh with the long run you might have the best half back there is or the other quarterback but if it don't have any blocking maybe they can't do that i think a strong defense is the most important thing you need to win on.
1,"yeah and then you know i think defense really is running wins wins uh oh the good run you might have the right half back who is for the best quarterback but if they don't have any back back they can't know anything i think a good defense is the most important way you need that win games,"
1,me and i you know i the defense really is what wins wins uh in not long term you can have the good half back there is even the best quarterback but know they don t t need any football maybe they can't do anything i think a good defense is the most important thing you need to win something.
1,yeah and i wish they can think the really is hard wins wins the offense the better best you can have the best right back this is or the best quarterback team if they don't have any defense maybe they can't do anything i think a good defense is the most important one kids need to win games.
1,yeah yes i you know i think it really like what wins wins uh oh the long run you can have at best thinking guy there is or the best quarterbacks if just don ` t have any blocking maybe they can help. do anything i think about good defense is the most important thing you need to win games.
1,yeah... i you know i think defense really decides what wins you uh in the long run you can have his best half back there is or the best quarterback but if people don and t need any more because they can't do anything i think a good defense is the most important thing you want to win games ;
1,"yeah hey do you, i good defense really is what wins wins uh in time long run you can have the best running back there is or our best quarterback but if they wouldn't have good blocking maybe they can't get anything i targeted a good defense is the most important thing you needed to win too."
1,"yeah and i you yeah i think defense it is what wins wins, in the next run you probably have the best half back this is or the worst quarterback but they he don't have any blocking maybe i can't do anything i think a good defense is the next only thing you use to win games."
1,yeah... i wanna know i think defense really is that wins like uh in the long run he can have the best half back who is probably the best defence but if they didn won t have any blocking maybe they can't do anything i think a good defense is the most important thing you need to win games.
1,yeah you ya he know i think defense up is what wins wins even in the long run you can have any defense half back there to maybe the best quarterback but if they don't see any blocking maybe they shouldn't do anything ju think that good defense is the most important thing you need to win games.
1,"yeah and i you, i think defense defense is what wins wins wins in years long run we will have the bad running back who is also your best quarterback but if they don't want any blocking maybe they can't do anything i think a good defense is the most important thing you need between all games."
1,you and i you know i think defense really matters what wins wins is in the long run you can have the best defense back there is on the kids kids but since they don's have any experience because they can't do anything i think a good defense is that most important thing you need to win games.
1,"yeah and i you know i think defense really is it wins? uh like the long way you can have the big half back there, or the best quarterback but if things don'd got any blocking maybe they can't do anything i think a good defense seems the most important thing you need to win games,"

1,"i think on these different elections it's actually um i think um i mean people vote in the larger elections because they feel too well you know our country's real important and you know if i elect if we help elect a president what's going to save us then, then the whole nation will be ok but you figure local elections shouldn't mean as much i suspect so they don * t really worry about their local mayor but something figuring like you know me and i think wrongly figuring that that well what good is another mayor having to do anyway because those federal politicians are no the right the things you know and you like that so i say that that because i don'l have um that that it doesn't doesn't change as much whereas i think it's the just the opposite. true i mean it's probably the idea that people could have this effect on a local level so think more people vote during the presidential than or local elections."
1,i think on the small elections it's actually um i think um i think people vote to the larger elections because they do like well you say the country's real important and you know when i elect if we help them out as people's coming to save us then yes then the whole country will be saved but they figure smaller elections don't mean that much people suspect so people don the t really worry over our local mayor or something figuring that you mean um yes i think wrongly figuring about that well what it is you mayor going? do anyway because our federal affairs are more important right now and you listen and we like this so i think not that that they don't have um that that it doesns and doesn't matter really much whereas aarhus says it's probably just the opposite is true i think it're probably true maybe the people could have more effect on a state level i think more people vote during the presidential elections iners elections.
1,"i think on the local elections it\'s because um i vote um i think people vote in the larger elections because they, like we to know the country\'s real important and you know if you, if voters can elect a president who\'s going to save us but the then the whole country will be saved but they figure so they don - t have so much i suspect so we don "" t really ask about their local mayor or something figuring that that, they and others think wrongly thinking that that well what good are this mayor going to do anyway because our federal taxes are more important right up and you know and stuff like that so people think so that that they don\'s act um that that it didn\'t isn\'t matter as much whereas some think it\'s probably what the opposite is it i think so\'s probably the case so people could have more rights on a national level i think, that vote during some presidential elections than local elections."
1,"i think on the local elections it's actually um i think um i think people think in their larger elections because they feel like them this that the country this a real important and you know about it say if we help one that president who's going to help us then the then the whole planet will be saved but they guess local elections will don t mean that much and suspect so we haven't really know about their local mayor or something but that you know? and i think wrongly figuring that, well what good is another mayor going to do anyway because our income taxes are more high right now and they know and stuff like that so some think that that that that don't have um that that one doesn't doesn's change as much whereas i think that'im probably just the opposite is true i think it's probably the way that people could have more effect as a local election i think thought people vote during the presidential elections than local elections."
1,they think on the local elections it's not um i think um we woulds vote in the provincial elections because they feel that well and know the country's real important and you know if i think if we help elect a president who's going to save us for the walking the way country will go saved but they figure local issues don't mean that much i suspect those people don't really think about their local politics or not figuring that you are um and people think you figuring that that well what good is another mayor going to do this because your federal taxes are more important right now and you know and stuff like it so people think that that that they don't have um that is it didn't can't happen as important whereas i think there's probably just the opposite is true i think it's just the case that people could have more effect on a personal level i think more people vote during the presidential race than before later.
1,"and think on the local elections he's funny wrong i think um i think people vote in the larger elections because they feel like to you do the vote's real important that you get if u like, we help be that president who's wanted to save us, the way a whole country will be saved but they figure local elections don, t mean too much i suspect so people don't really thinking about their local mayor or just figuring that you know um and i think wrongly figuring that that and what good is another mayor talking to go anyway because our federal taxes have are due right now. you know and shit like that many people think that that means they don't have something that that it doesn't doesn't matter as much whereas i think it's probably kangaroo judah opposite. true to think it ` s probably the case that people could have more effect on some local level they think more people vote during the presidential elections than local elections."
1,"i think on the first and it's actually um. think that i think it maybe in the regional elections because they feel like well you know the country and s real important to if, if i elect them we help elect a president who's there to save us all the then the whole country cannot be saved but they figure local elections don ` t mean that so i thought so you don't really worry about their local mayor or something figuring what you know um and i think wrongly figuring that that well what good is another mayor going to do anyway. our new taxes are more important just now and everyone know and stuff like that because people think that that that they don't have um that that this it'i wouldn t t matter very much whereas i think it o people probably just the opposite is true normal that it. s probably the possibility that people could have more effect on a local level that think more people vote during the presidential elections than local elections."
1,"i think on those local elections it'l said said i and um i retained our vote in the larger elections because you would like well we know the country ′ s real important and you know if i decide if we help elect a president who's going to represent us then the then the whole island might be saved but they figure the elections don ′ t mean that as i know so people don't really worry about their local mayor or i figuring i and know um and i think wrongly ands that well what good is another mayor done to people anyway because our property taxes look more important right now and you mean and stuff like, so why think that that that we don't have um and that it haven't doesn't matter do much whereas i say it = s probably true the opposite is true i think it's probably the case that people could do more effect on a local level i think more people vote during most presidential elections than local elections."
1,"i think on the local level it's actually um i think that i think people vote during the national elections because they feel like well you know the country the and most important and you know if i elect if we would elect a president who. s going to save us then the then we whole country will be saved and the if the elections don't mean know much i suspect so people didn'll really worry about their local mayor or something figuring that you know um so i think maybe figuring that that well what good is another mayor going to do anyway because some federal taxes get going down right now and you know and stuff are just so people think that and but they don't say um but that it doesn't doesn't matter as much whereas i hope it's probably just the point is, i think it probably is on the case that people could see more effect on the local level i expect more people vote during the presidential elections than local elections."
1,"i think on the local elections there's funny like i think um i think people vote in the larger elections because they look like, you know the world's real power? you know, i elect if we help elect a president we't going to save us then the kids the whole state will be different but really figure local elections don't cost that much i suspect so people don't really worry of their taxes cu'something figuring that maybe and um and i think do like that that well what good is another mayor going to look anyway because our federal taxes are more important right on and you know and stuff like what sometimes people think and that sometimes they don't have um that that it doesn't wouldn't change too much but i think it's probably just the very something true i think it was even is the case that people could put more effect on a local level i think more people vote during regular presidential elections than local elections."
1,i think on the local elections it's a but i think um i hope people vote in a larger area because they feel like that you know the state's really important and you know if i elect if we help elect a president who's going to save us then the then a whole country will become saved but so real local elections won't mean that much i suspect so people don by and really worry of their local mayor or something figuring that you think um well i think wrongly figuring that that well what good is their those going to do anyway because our federal taxes are more important right now and you know and people like that so people think that that but they didn't have decided that that it can't doesn't matter as much but me think it'is probably just completely opposite but true i think that's probably best case that people could see more effect in a local level i think more people vote during the presidential elections than local elections.
1,"i thought believe no local elections it matters? actually um i think um i think politicians vote in even larger elections because they sound like well you know the president\'s real right and you know if i elect if we help elect a president who\'s going to succeed us then the real our whole country will be saved but they hope local elections don\'t mean that much a suspect so people won\'t really worry about their local mayor or governor figuring that you know this and i think wrongly so so so well what good is another mayor to this of anyway because our federals are more important right now and you know good stuff and well so people think that maybe that they don\'t have um that that it doesn\'t doesn "" t matter, much but i think it\'s probably just the opposite. true people think it\'t probably the case that people could have more effect with a local level we think more people vote during the presidential elections so okay so )"
1,i think on the contrary way it's like um we think um i think people vote in the larger elections because they feel like well you know the country's real important and not know if i elect if we help elect a president who's going to save democracy then the then the whole country will be saved but they hope local elections don't mean that much i suspect most people don't really cares about their local mayor. is figuring that it and um and i are were figuring out that is what good is they us going to say anyway because our federal taxes are more important right here it you know and you like that so people feel that that that they don't have um that they it doesn't doesn'on they been him whereas i think everybody's g aly opposite is well to think it's probably the case that people has with more effect on a local level i think we un of during regional presidential elections than local elections.
1,"i say so on in elections it's actually um i, um what and people vote in the larger elections because they feel like well you know the country ` s real important and you know if somebody elect if we help elect people or who's going to save us then maybe then the whole country will be saved but they see local elections don't mean it and people suspect so people don't always worry about their local politics or something figuring that you know um and i think wrongly figuring that that well is good what another not going they do anyway because raising money taxes are more important right up here you know and stuff like that so people think that that that they don'know say um that say it wasn't doesn't matter as much whereas many think it's really just the most not true you think it's probably the case that people us have more support on a local level i think more people vote from the national elections than national elections '"
1,i think on the local elections it'm actually it they think um maybe. people vote in the larger elections because they feel how well you know a country's real important you and know if i elect if we help elect a president who's going to save us then the then the other country will feel saved. they figure local elections don't hurt that much. suspect so people of a or really talk about their local mayor or something figuring that you are um and i is wrongly figuring that that well what good is another city going to do anyway because our federal taxes are more important right now and we know and stuff like and so people think so just that they don't have um that but it doesn't make them you matter as much whereas i mean there's probably just the opposite not true i think it's probably the case that people can have it. on some some level i think more people vote during the presidential campaign than local government.
1,"we based on the local people everybody's actually um i think um i think people look in the local elections so they feel, well you know the country'n real important people you know if i elect if i help elect a president who's going to save me then the then the whole region will be saved but they figure local elections don't mean that much i do so people don't really worry about their local mayor not is figuring that you know why and i know wrongly thinking that is well what good is a mayor going to do me because our federal taxes are more important right there and you know this stuff like that so people think that and that they aren't have um that maybe it doesn't doesn ) t matter that much well i think that's probably just the rumor is true i think it's probably super connected that people could gain more effect over a local election who think more people vote against the presidential race than local elections."
