It was n't a tragic accident , it was him basically being an idiot . Not to mention throughout the movie I was distracted by his hideous beard. < br / >
If you want to see a fabulous film that takes place in one small setting , watch Hitchcock 's Lifeboat . Maybe Spacey should have watched it before filming this .

I figured the whole joke of the movie would be to see some rich white guy acting like Chris Rock , and then see Chris Rock react to people 's reactions .
Eminently forgetable except for the bad , bad performances .
Inbetween are the houses of the people where they indulge into what they reckon is pleasure-giving activities , trying to stay in touch with their human selves , yet in vain .

Little stories superbly told will get 10-of-10 from me over any movie with violence , foul language , ugliness and `` action '' . I am thinking particularly of `` Crash ''

Director Herbert Wilcox ( Neagle 's husband ) always thought Anna was the most exciting and talented femme on the screen . He was mistaken . She was improbably popular in Britain
When this movie was released , it spawned one of the all-time great capsule movie reviews : Sphinx Stinks . It does , but in a mesmerizing sort of way . The
Hunting is more effective as a team enterprise . Men who were not very good at bonding were Darwinianed out , leaving men who have a lot of team spirit . And
However , this one is the worst of the worst . The screenplay is weak and the acting , especially that of Tracey Pollan is abominable . I 've trudged off to
I think this movie 's good but the plot is familiar , it 's still good & has a few unintentional laughs !
One small bit of trivia , there was a real drunk-driving accident during filming that injured F.Murray Abraham , and resulted in the death of the intoxicated young driver that caused the
Yes , MTV there really is a way to market Daria . What started as a clever teenage angst- '' comment on everything that sucks and make the viewer feel better about
I was excited to view a CataluÃ±aÂ´s film in the BerlinÂ´s competition . But after the presentation I was total disappointed and furious . Too much blood , too much time ,
I got so emotional I wanted to scream in anguish , destroy the screen , readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism . Timberlake is horribly miscast ; in fact , casting
It is nice to see them struggle and training ! I was surprised how funny this movie was ! From start till the end you will laugh your pants off ! The
Well , Jesus of Montreal is basically an intelligent movie . The actors are indeed good and the technical side of the movie is okay . But , although I was very
Ghost Story is full of brilliant lightning and dark atmosphere , which is lightened by the strong presence of the beautiful and good willing ghost . The effects are simply breath taking
But perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her too ... < br / > < br / > The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have
I think the Chinese actresses are lovely , but I could not say they were good actors in this film . Yes , the cinematography is great , but really , I
This movie has about as much entertainment value as getting a root canal . It approaches the abyssmal depths of bad movie making , and then gets even worse . I wo
Veteran cameraman Robert Surtees provides a nice burnish to the cinematography though a level of graininess persists in the print . A big seller in its day , the soundtrack is a
This was a great book and the possibilities for a truly great film were definitely there . But the casting decisions completely wrecked the movie . Hanks is a great actor to
Fortunately , for most of us , our Thorazine kicks-in before we actually decide that it 's a bad idea to be driving a car . Not so for the makers of
The coffee slogan is a lousy thing to hang the plot upon , and the ending is thoroughly predictable . Frank Capra does this sort of thing much better. < br /
As a huge fan , I sort of know what the real Lennon and McCartney are like . The script was brilliant and Harris got Lennon 's accent , personality and mannerisms
The film seems to struggle with any horror factor , and a lot of the events that happen are simply silly rather than particularly frightening , and it is difficult to believe
That probably would have been best. < br / > < br / > I noticed the presence of Lindsay Crouse and Jay Thomas - both very good performers - and thought
I loved the the film . it beautifully analyzes Italian petty bourgeois society , how the leftists of the 70s have given up all their ideals and come to a happy arrangement
( When will I ever learn- ? ) The ecstatic reviewer on NPR made me think this turkey was another Citizen Kane . Please allow me to vent my spleen ... <
This movie is funny and suitable for any age . It is definitely family-type entertainment . The cast does a fine job playing folks in the mid-western town of Big Bean ,
More to the point , it 's not very thrilling and it certainly is n't scary . Phillips is a hard sell as a tough-as-nails , cynical cop stereotype , and Griffith
The best acting is done by Raymond Massey as Dr. Ingersoll , a good doctor turned evil . He is head of a spy ring attempting to get information from amnesiac Jane
This is a fantastic series first and foremost . It is very well done and very interesting . As a huge WWII buff , I had learned a lot before seeing this
Critics called COLOR PURPLE his entrance into intellectual fare . It is quite an entrance . No special effects , no swashbuckling , just brilliant story-telling based on a literary classic by
Another stupid dinosaur movie in which top secret military guys discover those lethal ( and very fake-looking ) prehistoric monsters running around killing people in gory ways . The original was bad
It did'nt follow formula , and among a 18-25 year old target American audience , that 's unforgivable as it was was'nt what they expected to see. < br / > <
I think that the music is better in cruel intentions 1 and the music is better in cruel intentions 3 . It is not the worst movie I saw , but in
They described `` blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence . '' I saw no `` intrigue . '' I instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie .
An awful , massive factory filled with human automata who live in hopelessly lifeless dormitories . Individuals dying early while rummaging for recyclable scraps in mountains of our E-waste . The birthing
I could probably crap out alphabet soup , rearrange what was left of the letters , and still have a better script . Two scenes in particular come to mind when I
The only thing that prevents this from being a really great movie is Burke -- she 's not a very good actress ( it 's no surprise that this has been her
The wife later rebels against the blackmail scheme but is killed in a fit of rage .... < br / > < br / > A very satisfying episode in many respects
This is one of the worst movies I 've seen in a long time . The story was boring , the dialogue was atrocious and the acting hammy . I 'm not
This movie contains personalities that so deliciously are playing their parts , I love the final , when nobody knows what are they gon na do about their life , but it
So for Matt Dillon fans this is watchable movie , just like for admirers of beautiful Diane Lane . Legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great but this is not movie for
Salman Khan remains as immature as 10 years ago compared to Aamir Khan . There were many songs in the movie all boring except `` Man Ko Ati '' . The Most
But I expect to be entertained. < br / > < br / > Add the fact that the cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor 's bad home movies
It 's not a movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax and watch something cute that 'll make you laugh . But it is a good movie
The story is told in a subtle but concise way , never being self-indulgent , flashy or over-expositional . The obviously tight budget may have contributed to the no-nonsense approach , but
Julia Stiles is a talented young actress , who with guidance from a reputable agent has a lot of potential . Obviously , the person who guided her into this travesty is
It 's beautifully shot and directed , and the casting is excellent . Paget Brewster delivers a very believable and likable performance . She has a quality about her , a charisma
While this might be a compliment in some situations , it 's certainly not here . Their constantly harassing the women on the show is funny at first . But since that
But it never came. < br / > < br / > Furthermore the movie was plagued with poor filming of poor special effects . Thus showing to much of a bad
Overall , I give this a 2 , because at least Disney made a film from an under-appreciated book series . But , I wish they did better . Either way ,
< br / > < br / > In other words : be afraid ! Be very afraid ! < br / > < br / > Of course , it would
So who delivered the laughs for me ? Without a doubt Mischa Auer delivered me some terrific gut busting laughs , he even steals the ending , it was great ! Speaking
Sheets earns bonus points for keeping the tone grim and nasty to the literal bitter end ( for example , almost all of the main characters wind up becoming zombie chow )
While the handsome Joe Buck ( Voight ) dreams of all the beautiful women of the world begging him to share a wild love fantasy , the poor Ratso Rizzo ( Hoffman
